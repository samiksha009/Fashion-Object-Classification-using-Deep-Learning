# Fashion-Object-Classification-using-Neural-Network-

**Objective:** To classify images of differenet pieces of clothing into their respective classes

**Dataset:** 
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

Fashion-MNIST is publicly available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist) and [Zalando Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) on Github.

**Business Impact:** E-commerce companies have lots of items for sale online which requires lots of images to be displayed on their websites, applications and on social media. And it takes lot of human power and time to separate these images into respective groups. This classifier which we are going to build helps businesses to categorize images into respective groups.

**Methodology:** For this project we will be going to use deep learning concepts like artificial neural networks and convolutional neural networks to build an image classification model which will learn to distinguish 10 different item images into their respective categories.

**Tools & Skills:** Python - PyTorch, Convolutional Neural Networks.
